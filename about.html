	<p id="about_words">It's in our nature to go out and have fun. In this day and age, in the world of smartphones and social media, it's always about us and how we share ourselves with the world. We go out with our friends, let loose, get toxicated (admit it), come home and do it all over again the next week (or next night). What we don't know is that the more we do this, the more damage we do to ourselves. We harm our health and our minds. As Buddha once stated...the mind is everything.<br><br>
	Alone In Zen helps you focus on your much needed alone time experience. We help guide you through releasing your self and embracing nature around you. Being alone and getting off social media isn't enough. This will be the only site you'll visit. You'll also need to change your diet and your way of life. We offer you new destinations, recipes, and stories to encourage self-improvement. So why not start now and begin your journey to enlightenment now!</p><br><br><br>
